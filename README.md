XashLib - feel easy to play anything.

I am sure it's not a secret that you can play Half-Life and other goldsrc games on xash3d engine for free, but for that you need to replace dlls, patch map files and do many other boring things. So I decided to make a little base of such games and mods for myself. That's it.

If you have somehow found this - idk, i just doing it from boredom.
